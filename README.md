OBLogger provides a super-simple set of macros and methods for logging DEBUG, WARN, INFO, and ERROR messages on the iPhone or iPad.  But it's designed for alpha or beta-testing debugging: the messages are saved to a log file, which you can then presumably retrieve.  Alternatively, for alpha testing you can rig up a button to present the log file in the provided view controller.  See the Example code for details.
